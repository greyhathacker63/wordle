Packages Used
This Wordle application leverages several powerful Flutter and Dart packages to deliver its features:

get: Utilized for GetX State Management and dependency injection, providing a reactive and efficient way to manage the application's state and navigation.

shared_preferences: Used for persistent local storage, enabling the game to save and load its state so users can pause and resume their games even after closing the app.

share_plus: Provides the functionality to share game scores and results with others.

flutter_timer_countdown: Powers the time-restricted game mode, managing the countdown timer displayed to the user.

cupertino_icons: Offers a set of iOS-style icons used throughout the application's UI.
